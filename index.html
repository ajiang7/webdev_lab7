      <td>Fact #1: Rank of Weights</td>
	  <td>Mercury has the lowest mass in this group, weighing in at only 0.33010 x 10<sup>24</sup> kg.</td>
	  <td>Venus has the second lowest mass, weighing in at 4.8673 x 10<sup>24</sup> kg.</td>
      <td>Uranus has the second greatest mass, weighing in at 86.811 x 10<sup>24</sup> kg.</td>
      <td>Out of the 4, Neptune has the greatest mass, weighing in at 102.409 x 10<sup>24</sup> kg.</td>

      <td>Fact #2: Volume of Giants</td>
      <td>Mercury has the smallest volume at just 6.083 x 10<sup>10</sup> km<sup>3</sup>.</td>
      <td>Going down the list, Venus has the second smallest volume at 92.843 x 10<sup>10</sup> km<sup>3</sup>.</td>
      <td>Surprisingly, despite not being the furthest planet away from the Sun, Uranus holds the largest volume of the quartet at 6,833 x 10<sup>10</sup> km<sup>3</sup>.</td>
      <td>Neptune has the second largest volume of the 4 planets at 6,254 x 10<sup>10</sup> km<sup>3</sup>.</td>

      <td>Fact #3: Packing Planets</td>
      <td>On the contrary, Mercury has the biggest mean density at 5,429 kg/m<sup>3</sup>.</td>
      <td>Not too far away, Venus has the second biggest mean density at 5,243 kg/m<sup>3</sup>.</td>
      <td>Next up, Uranus has the smallest mean denisty at 1,270 kg/m<sup>3</sup>.</td>

      <td>Fact #4: Moon = Satellite?</td>
      <td>Mercury has no natural satellites. Leading theory here is that the Sun's gravitational pull would have pulled it away.</td>
      <td>Venus has no natural satellites either. A leading hypothesis believes Venus once had a moon, but an impact that managed to reverse this planet's orbit caused the moon to crash into the planet.</td>
      <td>Uranus has the most natural satellites, numbering in at a total of 28 moons.</td>
      <td>After that, Neptune's natural satellites has a total of only 16 moons.</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Fact #5: Like Night and Day</td>
      <td>Due to it's close proximity to the Sun, Mercury has the longest length of day at 4,222.6 hours.</td>
      <td>Next to that, Venus has the second longest length of day at 2,802 hours.</td>
      <td>On the other side, Uranus has a length of day at just 17.24 hours.</td>
      <td>The shortest length of day clocks in at only 16.11 hours with Neptune.</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Fact #6: Relative to Earth?</td>
      <td>Getting warmer, Merucry has a distance away from Earth measured to roughly 77.3 x 10<sup>6</sup> km to 221.9 x 10<sup>6</sup> km</td>
      <td>Being a closest neighbor, Venus has a distance away from Earth at just 38.2 x 10<sup>6</sup> km to 261 x 10<sup>6</sup> km</td>
      <td>Next to that, Uranus has a distance away from Earth at 2,580.6 x 10<sup>6</sup> km to 3,153.5 x 10<sup>6</sup> km</td>
      <td>Being so far out there, Neptune has a distance away from Earth set at a ranging 4,319 x 10<sup>6</sup> km to 4,711 x 10<sup>6</sup> km</td>

      <td>Fact #7: Discoveries as old as Time</td>
      <td>Mercury's discoverer has been lost to time, but it's date of discovery was likely in a prehistoric period.</td>
      <td>Venus's discoverer has been lost to time too, but it's date of discovery was likely in a prehistoric period as well.</td>
	  <td>Uranus's discovery was made by William Herschel on March 13, 1781.</td>
      <td>Neptune's discovery was made by Johann Gottfried Gallebased on predictions by John Couch Adams and Urbain Leverrier on September 23, 1846.</td>
